####  🌌 UTOPIA-ExoplanetQuest

###  🚀 Habitable Worlds Observatory Navigator

## 🌠 Project Overview

Welcome to **UTOPIA-ExoplanetQuest**—a futuristic journey through our galaxy's habitable worlds! This project was created for the **2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge**, inspired by the challenge **"Navigator for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO): Mapping the Characterizable Exoplanets in our Galaxy."** Our mission is to visualize the pathways to exoplanets near our solar system and assess their potential for characterization by the HWO. Buckle up for a voyage through the stars! 🌌

## 🚀 Background

Since 1995, astronomers have uncovered thousands of **exoplanets**—worlds orbiting distant stars. Most of these discoveries have come through indirect methods, but that’s about to change! 🌠 The **Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)** is NASA's next big leap, designed to directly image exoplanets and reveal secrets of these Earth-like planets. With UTOPIA-ExoplanetQuest, you can explore which exoplanets are in HWO's sights, and how they could be our next interstellar neighbors.

Three key factors that shape HWO’s ability to characterize exoplanets are:

1. **🌌 Distance to the Exoplanetary System**: Distant exoplanets appear fainter and closer to their host stars.
2. **🔭 Telescope Diameter**: A larger telescope can distinguish exoplanets from their host stars more easily, improving observation clarity.
3. **📡 Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: A larger telescope can distinguish exoplanets from their host stars more easily, improving observation clarity.

## ✨ Project Features

- 🌌 **Interactive Galaxy Map**: Explore known exoplanets and their potential observation routes with a 3D visualization.
- 🗃️ **Archive with data table to observ exoplanets properties**: Use filters from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to customize your search for characterizable worlds.
- 👨‍💻 **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through potential targets for the next big mission in space exploration with ease.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

Here's the tech powering our voyage through the stars:

- **Frontend**:
  - ⚛️ **Next.js** + **TypeScript**
  - 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and responsive design
