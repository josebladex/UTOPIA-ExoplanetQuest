# UTOPIA-ExoplanetQuest-Front End

# Habitable Worlds Observatory Navigator

## Project Overview

This project was developed in response to the **2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge**, focusing on the challenge titled **"Navigator for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO): Mapping the Characterizable Exoplanets in our Galaxy."** The primary goal of this project is to visualize the observational paths across our galaxy to the known exoplanets in the solar neighborhood, assessing their potential for characterization by HWO.

## Background

Since 1995, thousands of exoplanets—planets orbiting stars outside our solar system—have been discovered, primarily using indirect methods. The **Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)** is an upcoming NASA initiative aimed at directly imaging exoplanets, enhancing our understanding of these Earth-like bodies. By visualizing which known exoplanets can be observed by HWO, we can better plan for this next-generation mission.

Two key parameters determine HWO's ability to characterize an exoplanet:

1. **Distance to the Exoplanetary System**: The further away an exoplanet is, the fainter and closer it appears to its host star.
2. **Diameter of the HWO Telescope**: A larger telescope allows for better separation of the exoplanet from its star.

## Project Features

- Interactive visualization of known exoplanets and their observational paths in the galaxy.
- Ability to filter exoplanetary systems based on distance and telescope diameter.
- Calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for various telescope sizes to determine characterizability.
- User-friendly interface for exploring potential targets for the HWO mission.

## Technology Stack

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - D3.js (for data visualization)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (or any other database for storing exoplanet data)
